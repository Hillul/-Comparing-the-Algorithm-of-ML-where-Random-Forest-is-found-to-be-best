When you have a new dataset, it is a good idea to visualize the data using different techniques in order to look at the data from different perspectives.  The same idea applies to model selection. You should use a number of different ways of looking at the estimated accuracy of your machine learning algorithms in order to choose the one or two to finalize.  A way to do this is to use different visualization methods to show the average accuracy, variance and other properties of the distribution of model accuracies.
